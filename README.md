Conversation Summary
TamperMonkey Script Development : Created a Binance trading calculator userscript with real-time market prices, optimal buy/sell price calculations based on order book analysis, and automated trading buttons

Overlay Consolidation : Combined separate overlays into single draggable overlay with all trading information

Price Calculation Strategy : Evolved from fixed percentage-based to order book analysis, ensuring buy price is at least 0.01% above current market for instant fills, with sell price optimized from order book data to minimize loss

React Form Integration : Implemented React-compatible form filling using native setters and proper event dispatching

Balance Display : Added real-time USDT balance display parsed as number type

Auto-Trading Buttons : Added "Fill" button (populate all fields) and "Buy" button (populate + submit with confirmation)

Human-Like Automation : Implemented mouse movement simulation, random delays (20-80ms ranges), and proper event sequences

Order Monitoring : Implemented monitoring to check if orders complete, with auto-cancel for stuck orders

Bulk Trade Execution : Added input for number of trades and "Start" button to execute multiple trades sequentially with proper waiting between trades

Field Order Correction : Fixed field identification - Buy Price (#limitPrice), Amount (#limitTotal[0]), Sell Price (#limitTotal[1])

Checkbox Verification : Added function to ensure required checkbox is checked before trade execution

Trade Completion Logic : Implemented waiting for "No Ongoing Orders" text to appear before proceeding to next trade, with minimum 5-second wait and auto-cancel after 10 seconds if order stuck

Files and Code Summary
e:\Binance\Tamper.txt : TamperMonkey userscript for Binance trading automation. Contains overlay creation, price calculation from multiple sources (chart close price, main price display, order book), order book analysis for optimal pricing, React form integration, automated trading buttons, order monitoring, and bulk trade execution. Update interval: 10ms for real-time data. Key functions: ensureCheckboxChecked(), clickConfirmWithRetry() (5 attempts), clickCancelConfirmWithRetry() (3 attempts), waitForTradeCompletion() (waits min 5s, checks for completion, cancels after 10s if stuck), humanClick() (20-50ms delays), simulateMouseMove(), setReactValue(), calculateOptimalPrices(), updateDisplay(), executeBulkTrades(), getTradingFee()

Field Order : Buy Price: #limitPrice, Amount Of Money: #limitTotal[0] (first), Sell Price: #limitTotal[1] (second) - both share same ID so must use array indexing

Price Calculation : Buy price = Math.max(medianBuy, currentPrice * 1.0001) to ensure instant fills; Sell price = highest viable sell from order book below buy price; Loss = (buyPrice - sellPrice) / buyPrice * 100

React Integration : Must use Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set to properly set React input values, followed by dispatching input/change/blur events

Order Book Analysis : Separates buy orders (green, --color-Buy) from sell orders (red, --color-Sell), calculates median prices, filters viable sells

Timing : 20-80ms delays for automation, 150-200ms for confirmation dialogs, 10ms update interval for real-time data, minimum 5 seconds wait after each trade, additional 5 seconds to check completion (10 seconds total before canceling stuck orders)

Fill Button Sequence : Buy Price → Amount → Sell Price (3 fields only)

Balance Storage : window.currentBalance stores parsed numeric balance value

Loss Calculation : Shows positive value using formula (buyPrice - sellPrice) / buyPrice * 100, displays both percentage and estimated USDT loss based on trade amount

Bulk Execution : Calculates total estimated loss including fees before starting, executes trades sequentially, waits for "No Ongoing Orders" text to confirm completion

Empty Open Orders Indicator : Text "No Ongoing Orders" appears when Open Orders section is empty

Most Recent Topic
Topic : Adding random delay (3-10 seconds) after successful trade completion before proceeding to next trade in bulk execution
Progress : User requested that after a trade successfully completes, the system should wait randomly between 3 to 10 seconds before starting the next trade to make the automation appear more human-like
Tools Used :

fsRead : Read complete Tamper.txt file to understand current waitForTradeCompletion implementation which waits minimum 5 seconds, then checks for completion for additional 5 seconds, and cancels stuck orders after 10 seconds total

Need to add random delay (3-10 seconds) after "completed" status is returned before proceeding to next trade iteration
